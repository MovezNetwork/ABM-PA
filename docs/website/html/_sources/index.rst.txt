MovezLab Agent-Based Models (ABM) documentation
======================================================

Welcome to the MovezLab ABM documentation. The MovezLab ABM is an ongoing project where we develop agent-based models for health interventions targeted at youth.

This documentation is intended to help third parties interested to test the applied agent based models. The MovezLab advocates open software and open source principles. You can find the github project and open source data links in the Installation section.
